Description:
  A collection of process capability index functions, such as
  C_p(), C_pk(), C_pm(), and others, along with metadata about each, like
  'LaTeX' equations and 'R' expressions. Its primary purpose is to form a
  foundation for other quality control packages to build on top of, by providing
  basic resources and functions. The indices belong to the field of statistical
  quality control, and quantify the degree to which a manufacturing process is
  able to create items that adhere to a certain standard of quality. For details
  see Montgomery, D. C. (2019, ISBN:978-1-119-39930-8).
